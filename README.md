machine learning
MPCTS, as a clustering algorithm, can help us discover similarities in datasets
Data files are used to store experimental data
The MPCTS file is our main algorithm file
Ma. The file is the entry point for the project
Different evaluation functions can be selected as clustering result evaluation criteria, such as NMI, ARI, and FMI
